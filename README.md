# Inspect pandas current errors in docstrings

Launch this [interactive notebook](https://github.com/pandanistas/docstring_notebooks/blob/master/docstring_error_interactive.ipynb) to inspect which errors are still present on some of the docstrings of the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Python package.

Feel free to browse through them, select your choice to work on, and open a PR with a proposed fix in the [pandas repository](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas).
